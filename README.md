Shader for wind + built in LOD support for URP made with Shader Graph.

As of now, there's no crossfade support for lod crossfade in URP/HDRP. This shader is to profide such functionality. 

# How To:
1. Copy to your project
2. Make a material of it and assign it 
3. Create your LOD Group and select Crossfade from dropdown in your LOD Group BUT DO NOT ENABLE the animation!.
4. Done!
